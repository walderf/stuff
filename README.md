# stuff - a collection of various ~~useful~~ things  

you can see what used to be here by viewing oldREADME.md, if you want. 

https://walderf.github.io is a replacement for what this was going to be. it's still a "WIP", but, it's at least up and better, overall, despite how amazing my Markdown formatting was for the original README.md.
